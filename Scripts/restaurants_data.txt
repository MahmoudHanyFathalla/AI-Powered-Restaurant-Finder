    Description: Ripe peach, citrus fruits, spice, and pie crust aromas all mingle and lift from the glass.

The finish is long and marked with hints of vanilla. This wine will continue to build richness as it ages in the bottle.

  - Name: Rosé, Beaujolais Rosé, Kermit Lynch
    Description: A simple Beaujolais in name and in price, Dupeuble’s rosé (and red . . . and white, for that matter) should not be mistaken for a basic bottle of wine. Sure, it is supremely thirst-quenching, as any self-respecting rosé should be, and it is darn fun to drink—we are talking about Beaujolais, after all. But consider that the Gamay vines here are up to seventy years old, and they grow in an intricate mix of granite, clay, and sandy soils. The outcome is a wine of real substance, with an extra dimension of depth along with an array of delightful flavors and textures.

  - Name: Sparkling, Azimut Brut Cava Nature
